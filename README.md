This is a Seminar Project from the Deep Learning and Speach Seminar from Wintersemester 17/18 at the University of Hamburg.
The project goal is to implement and evaluate a sequence-to-sequence-model to convert graphemes to phonemes (G2P) based on the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).
